This contains environmental file that I find useful for MacOS. 
It you need these environments set up you can download this project:

When you get a new computer, you should config these things

- mkdir ~/Development/Learning

-  Configure your terminal environment
   import the "BasicMacShellProfile.terminal" into the xterm
   (Q: what about iterm and iterm2)
- change your shell to /bin/bash in the terminal   

- Install Brew
   look up how to install via net or
   	/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

-  brew install git
   update your PATH to use the git from local
